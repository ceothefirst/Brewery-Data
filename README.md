##Brewery Product Sales Analysis in West-African Countries

Welcome to the Brewery Product Sales Analysis project! In this analysis, we dive deep into the sales data of brewery products in West-African countries to uncover valuable insights and trends. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file and a Power BI published dashboard that showcases our key findings and the steps taken to approach the problem.

##Project Overview
This analysis project aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sales performance of brewery products in West-African countries. We sought to answer key questions such as:
* What are the top-selling brewery products in each country?
* How do the sales vary across different regions?
* Are there any seasonal patterns or trends in the sales data?
* What are the factors influencing the sales of brewery products?



Among many others, these were a few questions from our executives that were answered in the analysis.
Questions answered:
* Within the space of the last three years, what was the profit worth of the breweries, inclusive of the anglophone and the francophone territories?`
*  Compare the total profit between these two territories in order for the territory manager, Mr. Stone to make a strategic decision that will aid profit maximization in 2020.`
* Country that generated the highest profit in 2019`
* Within the last two years, the brand manager wants to know the top three brands consumed in the francophone countries




##Files Included
* analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code, data preprocessing steps, and data analysis performed during the project. It provides a step-by-step approach to our analysis, including data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling.
* sales_dashboard.pbix: This Power BI published dashboard presents a visually appealing and interactive representation of our analysis. It allows users to explore the sales data, view key metrics, and gain insights through interactive visualizations and filters.




##Steps Taken
1. Data Collection: The dataset was pulled from one of Utiva.io’s business analysis courses, Along with a lot of the questions that helped us engage and practice our new Python skills. We accurately imported the dataset into Pandas DataFrame on Python. This step ensured the accuracy and reliability of our analysis of the available dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: We conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the sales and consumption data’s trends and patterns. This involved visualizing key variables, identifying outliers, and understanding the relationships between different features.
3. Feature Engineering: We engineered new features, such as calculating total revenue, average sales per region, and identifying year on year patterns, to enhance our analysis and provide additional insights.
4. Power BI Dashboard: We developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to present our findings visually. The dashboard includes dynamic visualizations, filters, and key performance indicators to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
